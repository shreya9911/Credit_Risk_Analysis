# Credit_Risk_Analysis
A classification problem - we need to identify whether or not a customer will pay credit card bill next month

This dataset has 30000 total instances and 24 relevant client information features including their age, gender, due payments, marital status, 
initial borrowed amount, past due’s etc. The ultimate goal here is to train and compare multiple predictive models using supervised 
learning techniques and finally selecting an optimal model that best classifies defaulters and non-defaulters in the defaulter’s column 
accurately.
 
Metrics used : Accuracy, Precision, recall, f1-score
